## Description

For this assignment, I created an employee directory with React. I broke up the application's UI into components, managed component state, and responded to user events.


## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Tech/Modules Used :

### [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) : 
* JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive.
* JavaScript(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
* With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

### [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) : 
* React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.
