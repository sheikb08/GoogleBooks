## Description

For this assignment, I created a new React-based Google Books Search app using React components, working with helper/util functions, and utilizing React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches.


## Tech/Modules Used :

### [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) : 
* JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive.
* JavaScript(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
* With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

### [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) : 
* React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.

### [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) : 
* MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.

### [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) : 
* Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.
